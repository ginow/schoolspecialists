  <p class="About">
    We are a team of highly skilled professionals who are extremely good at landing and getting killed by enemies in
    School in Battleground Moblie India (a.k.a PUBG)
    <br />
    <br />
    We show no mercy towards enemies.
    <br />
    When we get killed by them.

  <h3>Our Playing Strategy</h3>
  <p>We first start inviting enemies in plane and land at School. At school we get loots by killing bots.<br />
    To move towards "laal building" we knock an enemy and then push as shown in figure below.

    Once we reach B building's terrace, we camp like noobs, then enemies rush towards us and we get killed
